LangGraph is an open sourced extension of LangChain that’s useful for creating stateful AI agents by modeling workflows as nodes and edges in a graph. You can think of your agent’s logic as a flowchart where:

Nodes are the actions (for example “ask the LLM” or “run this tool”)

Edges are the arrows (what happens next)

State is the information passed around

LangGraph is especially good at providing the following benefits:

Flow control: You define exactly what happens when.

Stateful: The framework preserves conversation history for you.

Easy to use: Just adding a decorator to an existing Python function makes it a tool.

Production-ready: It has built-in error handling and retries.
